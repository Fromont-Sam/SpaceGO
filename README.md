You'll need SFML to build and run this project. For more information, go to the official [SFML website and follow the instructions](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).

Once you've installed SFML you can clone this project and build it with CMake. 

Tutorial using CMake here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7dRfr5sSQc

I made all components by myself (buttons, checkbox, etc...). I'd be happy to see you using them in your own projects, if you want to. Don't hesitate and tell me about it! :D

# Panels presentation
There is no panel in SFML but I keep speaking about panels when I create views with every kind of technologies. That's because my first GUIs were made with Java Swing, so don't pay attention to that. :) 

## Menu panel
This panel doesn't contain a lot of things but it links every other panels so that's the most important view of the game.

## Game panel
Second most important panel, the game panel! I don't think I need to say more ^.^

## Shop panel
This panel allows you to buy new spaceships models and colors. You earn stars by playing the game and you can spend these starts to use the shop.
